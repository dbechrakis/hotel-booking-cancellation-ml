# Validation record

Executed the complete revised notebook against the 119,390-row public source, with its SHA-256 recorded in `outputs/validation.json`. Python cells were executed sequentially in a single process because kernel sockets were unavailable. All cell outputs are saved.

The split uses inferred booking date and fully matured training stays. Training: 79,590; test: 23,989; purged: 15,811; cutoff: 2017-01-12.

Old random-split scores and office documents are superseded. No repeated temporal cross-validation, live intervention or production deployment was performed. Prepared with AI assistance.
